    * Correctly evaluate expressions containing and and or.

### Class 3 - Feb. 1

1. Creating Functions
    * Define a function that takes parameters.
    * Return a value from a function.
    * Test and debug a function.
    * Set default values for function parameters.
    * Understand why it is good to divide programs into small, single-purpose functions
2. Errors and Exceptions
    * To be able to read a traceback.
    * To be able to describe the types of situations in which typical errors occur.
3. Defensive Programming
    * Explain what an assertion is.
    * Add assertions that check the programâ€™s state is correct.
    * Correctly add precondition and postcondition assertions to functions.
    * Explain what test-driven development is, and use it when creating new functions.
    * Explain why variables should be initialized using actual data values rather than arbitrary constants.
4. Debugging
    * Debug code containing an error systematically.

1. Command line programming
    * Use the values of command-line arguments in a program.
    * Handle flags and files separately in a command-line program.
    * Read data from standard input in a program so that it can be used in a pipeline.
