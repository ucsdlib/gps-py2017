Quiz 1 

Consider the following R code has been run (the numbers are the line numbers and not part of the code):

1 mass <- 47.5
2 age <- 122
3 mass <- mass * 2.3
4 age <- age - 20

What is the value of the following: 

a) mass at line 1

b) age at line 2

c) mass at line 3

d) age at line 4

3. Assume the code from the previous question has been run in R.  What is the result of: 

mass < age 

a) true 
b) false 


4. You have a cluttered R environment, what is the command for removing all objects in your current R session: 

a) rm(ls())
b) rm(mass)
c) rm(list=ls())
d) %reset

5. What following command installs the following packages: ggplot2, plyr, gapminder

a) install.packages('ggplot2', 'dplyr', 'gapminder')
b) library('ggplot2', 'dplyr', 'gapminder')
c) installed.packages()
d) update.packages()

sep: a character string to separate the terms.  Not
          ‘NA_character_’.

collapse: an optional character string to separate the results.  Not
          ‘NA_character_’.

Quiz 2

2. You've just received a data file in a CSV format from you data warehouse group.  You need to read this file into R as a dataframe names 'data', but you want to preserve the character values in the dataset.  Which of the following will accomplish this in R:  

a) data <- read.csv('/user/me/datawearhouse-25.csv', StringsAsFactors = FALSE)
b) data <- read.csv2('/user/me/datawearhouse-25.csv')
   data[charvector] <- as.character(data[charvector])
c) data <- read.table('/usr/me/datawearhouse-25.csv', StringsAsFactors = FALSE)
d) data <-read.csv('/usr/me/datawearhouse-25.csv')


3. Consider the following data frame df created by running: 
 > df <- data.frame(n=sep(0,20,5), s=5:1, b=LETTERS[1:5])
 > df
   n s b
1  3 5 A
2  5 4 B
3  7 3 C
4  9 2 D
5 11 1 E

If I execute the following command in R, what will result?

 > mynewdf <- df[df$n<=7,]
   
mynewdf will contain a copy of df
mynewdf will contain a copy of the df data frame with all rows where n is less than or equal to 7 dropped
mynewdf will contain a copy of the df data frame with all rows where n is less than to 7 dropped
mynewdf will be a vector of numbers less then 7

data <- read.csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/resbaz/r-novice-gapminder-files/master/data/gapminder-FiveYearData.csv')

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/resbaz/r-novice-gapminder-files/master/data/gapminder-FiveYearData.csv

I've read in the gapminder data as a data frame and used the str() function to instpect it. 

> data <- read.csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/resbaz/r-novice-gapminder-files/master/data/gapminder-FiveYearData.csv')
> str(data)
'data.frame':   1704 obs. of  6 variables:
 $ country  : Factor w/ 142 levels "Afghanistan",..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...
 $ year     : int  1952 1957 1962 1967 1972 1977 1982 1987 1992 1997 ...
 $ pop      : num  8425333 9240934 10267083 11537966 13079460 ...
 $ continent: Factor w/ 5 levels "Africa","Americas",..: 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 ...
 $ lifeExp  : num  28.8 30.3 32 34 36.1 ...
 $ gdpPercap: num  779 821 853 836 740 ...

What is the class of this object? 

How many rows and how many columns are in the data object object? 

How many distinct countries are recorded in this data frame? 

 The default method combines its arguments to form a vector.  All
     arguments are coerced to a common type which is the type of the
     returned value, and all attributes except names are removed.
